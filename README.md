Turtle Game
I learned how to used blender to make the turtle, i've watched a couple videos about this before but never made it beyond the donut tutorial. I also learned a significant (starting from 0) amount of c# to create the objective system. I also learned how to use Unity's animaiton software to create the spinning wheel.
